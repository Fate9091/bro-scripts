# bro-scripts
Various Bro scripts

Most should work in 2.3, some have been updated to work in 2.4. 

* misc/ - mostly just stuff that I figured out how to do a while ago and needed a place to stash it
* exploitkit/ - a couple of different ideas about detecting the general patterns in an exploit kit for successful exploitation.
* dynamicdns/ - script to look for dynamic DNS hostnames based of a dyndns domain list
* 2.2-scripts/ - stuff I (nor anybody else has updated)
